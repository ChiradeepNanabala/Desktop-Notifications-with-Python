# Desktop-Notifications-with-Python

The purpose of this application for desktop notifications is to provide us with regular reminders of the various tasks that we need to complete during the day.

Today, I am planning to develop a desktop application that will send me reminders to drink water every hour.

To create desktop notifications with Python, plyer library can be used, which provides a simple interface to various platform-specific features, including notifications.

To install plyer, you can use pip:

pip install plyer

This notification can be customized with various arguments to the notify() method. Fore more information, you can refer plyer documentation.
